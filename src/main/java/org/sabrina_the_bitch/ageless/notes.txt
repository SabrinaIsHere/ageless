Player Mixin Notes -
    - Vampirism:
        - Mix into onDeath(DamageSource damageSource) to trigger vapirism if potion effect is present
        - Look into zombies daylight fire mechanics
        - Mix into ActionResult interact(Entity entity, Hand hand) for the tool-less blood sucking
        - Attributes for the speed and strength buffs?
        - Check night vision potion mechanics for permanent night vision
        - Mix into the addStatusEffect() function for poison immunity (also isInvulnerableTo(DamageSource damageSource))
        - Look into the custom nbt stuff for vampirism (readCustomDataFromNbt(NbtCompound nbt), writeCustomDataToNbt(NbtCompound nbt))
        - Mix into Either<SleepFailureReason, Unit> trySleep(BlockPos pos) for sleeping during the day
        - canConsume(boolean ignoreHunger) can be modified to only allow consumption of blood
            - ItemStack eatFood(World world, ItemStack stack, FoodComponent foodComponent)/hungerManager can be mixed into as well
*Note: Still need to go through LivingEntity
        - Mix an interface into LivingEntity to deal with blood levels?

onDeath injection notes -
    - Canceling onDeath at the header in LivingEntity and ServerPlayerEntity doesn't actually stop the death
    - onDeath is called in damage() (line 1226) in LivingEntity
    - Investigating totem of undying mechanics to try to cancel death
    - Possible to cancel death with LivingEntity.setHealth(1.0F) in onDeath
        - Use LivingEntity.clearStatusEffects() as well
